CheckLT is a program verification tool for Java which can help you use
taint tracking to find defects in your software. CheckLT provides an
easy to install verification toolset, a simple, non-invasive syntax
for annotating programs, and a dynamically configurable security
lattice.

CheckLT was born out of a research project at the University of
Central Florida where we are researching creating tools for secure
information flow analysis for Android applications. CheckLT does not
implement full information flow security, but instead aims at being a
lightweight security analysis toolkit for Java.

Though CheckLT relies on Checker Framework for its base functionality
(in fact, it is a plugin for the checker framework) CheckLT is being
distributed independently of Checker Framework as a part of an
experiment by this author to make formal verification tools more
easily accessible outside of the research community. You can think of
it as a "Click, Run, Verify!" approach to formal methods software!

Enjoy CheckLT!
