This directory contains annotated versions of library classes (such as the
JDK).

See chapter "Annotating libraries" in the Checker Framework Manual for
information on using these classes.

Some generated .jar files are checked into the repository, because
generating them requires external dependencies (the Annotation File
Utilities) and because it prevents bugs related to different people using
different versions of the JDK.

If you need stub files for additional library classes -- in the JDK or another
library -- those can be generated using the StubGenerator tool along with some
manual annotating.  The "Annotating libraries" chapter of the manual describes
this process as well.

If you do create new stub files please share them with us via email at
checker-framework-dev@googlegroups.com.  Thanks!
